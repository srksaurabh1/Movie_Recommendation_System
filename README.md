### Content based
This filtration method is based on the data provided about the products. The algorithm recommends products that are similar to the ones that a user has liked in the past.

#### Disadvantages
do not get much exposure to user
if user does not try different product buisness cannot expand

### Collaborative
This filtration method is based on the combination of the user’s behavior and comparing and contrasting that with other users’ behavior in the database. The history of all users plays an important role in this algorithm.

2 types of collaborative

User-based Here we find similar past preference patterns This is achieved by making matrix of items ##### Disadvantages
Taste of peope may change - Fickle-minded
Users >>>> Items - hence difficult to maintain such large matrix
Fake users may make our alogrithm biased
Item-based find similar movies instead of similar users and then recommending similar movies to that ‘A’ has had in his/her past preferences 
#### Advantages 
over User-based
Movie's don't change - like people's taste
easier to maintian matrices of items
movies cannot be fake

### Hybrid
Content + Collaborative
